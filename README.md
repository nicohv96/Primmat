PrimMat

PrimMat is a free educational platform designed to support the teaching of mathematics at the primary school level. Its goal is to make technology accessible for both teachers and students by providing an interactive and user-friendly environment.

Developed with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform allows teachers to manage and create customized educational resources, generating content and exercises tailored to the needs of their students. On the other hand, students can access these exercises through a simple interface, enabling them to learn and practice independently.

The project is based on a prior analysis of the most commonly used didactic resources and the main challenges faced in learning mathematics at the primary level. With this foundation, PrimMat seeks to implement effective solutions through software, contributing to the improvement of educational quality, encouraging active learning, and supporting the educational community in mathematics.
